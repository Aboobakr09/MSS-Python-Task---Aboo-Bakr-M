MSS Task - Python Fundamentals Mastery Challenge

Documentation:
# 1. Data Types and Slicing:
- We have created a list with 8 different data types.
- We are using for loop to print the elements of the list.
- __name__ is a built-in variable that evaluates to the current module's name.
- We are printing the elements of the list and the data type of the elements inside the for-loop.
- Using slicing, we print the required values.

# 2. Functions and Control Flow
- We defined the function calculate_discount to calculate the discounted price. When the function is called, it'll return the discounted_price.
- As the User gives the Original Price and with the function calculate_discount, the Discounted Price is calculated.
- Hence, We have calculated discounted_price using the function.
- Using elif statements, The Value of the item will be printed depending on the price of the item after the discount has been applied.

# 3. File Handling
- with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable.
- Using the with-open() statement, we read the data from the txt file product_description.
- Inside the with-open() statement, we used another with_open() statement, to create a new txt file formatted_description to write the data inside the file.
- Using for loop, every line in the product_description is read and is written in the formatted_description.
- the title() method is used to capitalize the first letter of all elements inside a list.

# 4. Advanced-Data Structures
- We have created a dictionary named customer_info with keys: 'name', 'age', and 'purchase_history'.
- We have assigned respective values to the keys.
- To print the Customer's name, We created a new variable customer_name, and printed the data using slicing.
- To print the second purchase of the customer, we directly applied slicing without creating any new variables.

# 5. Classes and Objects
- We have defined a class Book.
- Inside the class Book, a special method named __init__ is defined. This method is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. It takes four arguments: self, title, author, and genre.
- A method named set_information is defined in the class Book. This method is used to update the information on objects inside the class Book. It also takes four arguments: self, title, author, and genre.
- Another method named display_information is defined in the class Book. This method is used to print the information of a Book object. It only takes one argument: self.
- We Create an instance of the class - Book.
- We then, Update new information using the set_information method which was defined earlier.
- Using the method display_information, we prints the updated information.
